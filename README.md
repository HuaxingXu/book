## Supplementary materials for the book Analytic Methods of Sound Field Synthesis by J. Ahren


### Website

### Usage

* Download the files/repository.
* Download [Chebfun](http://www2.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/download/) and unzip it into the Common folder. (You’ll need this only for
those scripts that involve Gaussian sampling of the sphere.)
* Start Matlab and add the Common folder and its subfolders to the Matlab path
(File -> Set path -> Add with subfolders -> then select the Common folder ->
Save -> Close).
* Open the individual scripts and comment or uncomment the parameters that you
want to use or that you do not want to use.

The Common package includes the doublefactorial function from the
